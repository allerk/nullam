Documentation (user manual) for each project is located in the appropriate folders.

In total, about a week was spent, mainly on the front-end (3-4 days), and back-end template was already prepared before start, so most of the work on the server side usually took time just to copy-paste the logic for each entity and writting tests (2 days). Some minor bugs or speciall features (that I didn't know how to do) took much time from every day. Usually spent from 6-9 hours per day. In total about ~56 hours.

To be honest, I know that it is better to replace some of the logic from the front-end to the back-end, like partial validation or some forbiddens to manage data seed. But as was earlier decided sending project at Friday. Basically all necessary requirements are done.
